        <li>She always seemed studious, positive, cheerful, and sober</li>
        <li>Saw her often reading scriptures between classes</li>
        <li>Graduated a year before me</li>
        <li>We both were into theater</li>
        <li>I knew where to find her</li>
        <li>Fellow students had warned me she was "Mormon" but I really didn't
        know what that meant and it didn't seem important to me either</li>
        <li>To me, she was the finest example of a good Christian I had ever met</li>
