            <li>62 Stations and 420 Likes on Pandora.</li>
            <li>Strange mixture of genres, mostly without lyrics.</li>
            <li>If the lyrics are going to be lame the music better be great :P</li>
            <li>Lately, gravitating toward stuff that makes me feel "cool" or like dancing.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>For a very short period, when I thought it was important to be able to listen to a specific track when I wanted to, I nurtured a grooveshark account.</li>
            <li>Now, I only use Grooveshark to send links to friends when I hear something on Pandora.</li>
            <li>Grooveshark radio just isn't as good as Pandora's. And it's too tedious to maintain lists of my favorite music and build my own playlists.</li>
