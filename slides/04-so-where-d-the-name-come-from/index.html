	<ul>
		<li>Timothy Stoutenburg -- the hairy dude with the braids</li>
		<li>Had some relationship with my mom, when she was pregnant with me, but apparently not my dad</li>
		<li>He was hit by a car while drunkenly walking across the street</li>
		<li>Lost an arm, and legs didn't fully recover</li>
		<li>I guess my mom was going to marry him, but it fell through after the accident</li>
